Hello! 

Who the hell are you? Why are you looking at my profile? Get out!

My name is JTH (@dev-larrikin), but you can call me Jason if you would like.


I'm interested in a wide variety of things that might be pertinent to a github user, including computers! 

More specifically, my main interests are around game development. Currently hyperfixated on rendering technology. Strong believer that procedural generation tools should not just be used to create a large section of content, but should provide a canvas on which creative people can build upon - and a strong believer that current standard practices do not adequetly reflect this. Also deeply interested in NPC and other non-player entity simulation (thank you Tarn and Zach Adams).

Less specifically, I'm still interested in a wide variety of things; AI technology (LLM's are cool, but so are most NN's), compilers, making custom libraries and tool kits for my projects, low-level design paradigms, ect. Currently using a lot of C++, Rust, GLSL, and Python (as well as GDscript and GSL). Interested in learning more about Lua. Would like to create my own language one day, in more ways than one.

Less pertinently, my interests also include art, writing, physical fitness, I've been described a "foodie" and an "alcoholic", I enjoy nature, and long-winded pretentious philosophical discussions about nothing.

Currently learning Vulkan and Rust. Also learning everything else, but mostly focused on Vulkan and Rust. Building a rendering engine and if that works out, a game engine as well (based on Vulkan and Rust).


I'm not looking to collaborate, and please don't reach out to me.

(Just kidding, feel free to email me)
